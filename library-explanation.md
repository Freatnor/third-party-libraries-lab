## Data Binding ##

The purpose of this library is to allow the developer to write bindings for classes/objects and methods right in the xml
instead of in java. This allows you to define behavior right in the xml where the structure is already defined instead of having to pull out the views in the java to work on them.

### Example Use ###
As an example I have set up a simple app that populates a recycler view using databinding.
